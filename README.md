# ðŸ”½ Where to Download Flutter SDK

ðŸ‘‰ Official site (always latest & safest):

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Thatâ€™s the official Flutter installation page from Google.

# Path Setting

Once youâ€™ve downloaded and extracted the `Flutter` SDK, you need to set the PATH so that you can run flutter from anywhere in your terminal.

# ðŸ”§ Setting up Flutter SDK on Windows

## 1. Download & Extract Flutter
- Go to the official [Flutter Windows Install Page](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows).  
- Download the latest **Stable ZIP** (e.g., `flutter_windows_x.x.x-stable.zip`).  
- Extract it to a folder (recommended path):  

C:\src\flutter
