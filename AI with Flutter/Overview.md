## 🧭 Overview: What’s Happening in This Lab?

In this chapter, you're going to do something pretty cool — **integrate an AI agent into a Flutter app**. Here’s how everything ties together:

---

### 🧱 Tech Stack Breakdown

- **Flutter**: Your front-end framework – this is where users interact.
- **Vertex AI Search**: Acts as your **vector database** – storing and retrieving AI-friendly data.
- **Reasoning Engine**: Powered by **LangChain + Vertex AI**, this is the brain of your agent.
- **Gemini LLMs**: These are your **large language models**, smart enough to respond to both text and image prompts.

Yup, you’re building a proper, modern, intelligent app.

### 💻 What's Set Up for You

This lab is **pre-provisioned**, meaning the environment is ready to go. Here's what you get:

- 🖥️ **VSCode** running via **code-server** (cloud IDE)
- 🧩 **Flutter + Dart extensions** pre-installed
- 🌐 **fwr**: A simple tool to serve your Flutter app in a browser as a web app

So you don’t have to worry about installing anything locally — just jump in and build!

### 👩‍💻 Who Is This For?

This lab is designed for **developers of all experience levels** — even if:

- You're not super familiar with **cloud development**
- You’ve never touched **Flutter** before

It **helps if you know some Python** and are at least a little familiar with the **Flutter framework**, but even without that, you’ll still be able to:

- Review Flutter code
- Understand what it’s doing
- Test the app like a pro

---

### 🧠 What Will You Learn?

- How to connect a **LangChain-based AI agent** to a **Flutter app**
- How **Gemini** responds to **text and image prompts**
- How to serve and interact with your app directly in the browser
- How various cloud tools fit together in an AI-powered workflow

This is real-world, modern app development — made simple and accessible.
